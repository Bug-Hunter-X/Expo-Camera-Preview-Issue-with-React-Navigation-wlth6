This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` API in conjunction with React Navigation.  Specifically, when navigating away from a screen containing the camera and then back to it, the camera preview may fail to render correctly or may become unresponsive. The preview might show a blank screen, a frozen image, or just a black screen.  This seems linked to the way React Navigation manages component lifecycles and how the Camera component interacts with native modules.
